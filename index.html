                <p class="text once">FashHanger is a bespoke sustainable high-fashion accessory
                    company based out of Berlin, currently operated by Siesly and her sister Ashely.
                    They needed help for a big rebrand and wanted to relaunch their website.
                </p>
                <p class="text once">Their goals were simple, create a unique e-commerce store that bring
                    a wonderful shopping experience at every stage of the buyer’s journey.</p>

                <p class="text">
                    the personality section of this persona was based off the Myers Briggs personality test. According
                    to the
                    Myers Briggs, there are 16 potential user personality types. Our template integrates questions from
                    this
                    online personality test example into a series of sliding bar graphics. If you’re confused as to what
                    the sliders mean, check out the Myers Briggs basics article.</p>

                </p>
                <p class="text">I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what I’m working on (and
                    find the parallels later). Personally, I prefer paper with a grid so
                    I can convey things responsively. Most of the time perfection isn’t an issue and the sketches are
                    just for me.</p>

                <p class="text-last">I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you in to each
                    screen. For each of those screens
                    I added a floating footer that allows users to see where they are in that particular flow and jump
                    around as needed.”
